code-server allows you to run [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
on any machine anywhere and access it using a web browser.

## Highlights

- Code on any device with a consistent development environment
- Use cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and more
- Preserve battery life when you're on the go; all intensive tasks run on your server

## Getting Started

We offer an [install script](./install.sh) for Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD that automates most of the process; the script uses the system package manager (if possible). Alternatively, see [Installation](./docs/install.md#quick-install) for manual installation instructions for most use cases.

If you use the install script, you can see what occurs during the install process by running the following (there are no file changes at this point):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh -s -- --dry-run
```

To install, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh
```

When done, the install script prints out instructions for running and starting code-server.

We also have an in-depth [setup and configuration](./docs/guide.md) guide.
